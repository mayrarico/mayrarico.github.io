        Is your fitness tracker playing up, constantly misreporting your heart rate and claiming you’re burning wild amounts of fat? Bad news: it’s probably broken. Or, good news: It might be working fine, and you’re pregnant.

                One lucky couple turned to a Reddit thread last week with questions regarding the devices sensor. The FitBit charger appeared to be showing a heartbeat that was consistently higher than normal. What they soon discovered was that the user was pregnant! The couple who choose to remain anonymous have been trying to have a baby for a couple of months now. They are extremely excited with the news and are thankful for their Fitbit and journey to come!
