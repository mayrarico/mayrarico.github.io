    I am Mayra Rico! I am one of the few people that likes to be called by my last name... so moving forward please call me Rico!
    
        <p>I decided this year to learn how to cook! Being a broke student I decided to go to Half-Price Books which is where I walked out with Juli Bauer's Paleo Cookbook. Little did I know such a small purchase would change my life.</p>

 Well... I decided to go all out! I ended up joining CrossFit and started to pursue my desire to learn how to code.
    <br>I'm extremely excited about the possibility of leaving the finance world and starting to live a happy and healthy life.
