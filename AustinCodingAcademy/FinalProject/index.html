                    <p>My dad started working at age 15. In all his life he has only taken off 2 weeks from his job as a construction worker.  If you want to know who I model my work ethic from, it's my dad. If you want to know why I have to succeed, read the first two sentences of this paragraph again.</p>

<p>My mom was only allowed to attend school until the 3rd grade. Since moving to the US she went back to school and learned how to read and write in English. She is now pursuing her GED with the hopes of one day becoming a teacher. If you want to know who inspires me, it's my mom.</p>

<p>My two younger brothers watch every move I make. If you want to know why I do what I do, it's for them. My success is measured by the legacy that my brothers will inherit.

                    <p>I proudly bleed burnt orange. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in May 2014 with a B.A. in Government and a busines minor. I am very proud to be a first generation college graduate. I am doing all that I can so that my younger brothers are also able to walk the stage... even if it's at A&M.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am currently enrolled in the Austin Coding Academy. I have always had an interest in coding but never really did anything with that interest. It's important for me to continuously be learning and in a challenging environment. My expected graduation date is December 2016.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am also currently enrolled in the  Austin Community College Accounting Specialist program. I am currently attending night classes to fulfill the CPA requirements for the Texas Board. I plan to be abe to sit for the CPA Exam May 2017.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Experience.</h2>
                    <p>I currently work for PeopleAdmin, Inc. as the Accounting Team Lead, AR and AP. I manage a small team and manage the keys to the companies cash balance. I love working in an emerging role with a dedicated team.</p>
                     <p>Before becoming the team lead I was a staff accountant, accounting clerk, and a customer database intern at PeopleAdmin. I am very proud to have moved up so quickly in the company. I attribute my success to my parent's teaching as well as to my mentors and role models within the company. </p>
                     <p>I have three career goals: to be able to tell my dad that he can retire and quit his job, to take on an executive level role, and finally to run and manage Vista Equity Partners. As long as I am able to build onto these three goals I am willing to take on all new adventures.</p>
